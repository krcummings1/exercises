        <p><b>  
          I recently took a road-trip down California's Pacific Coast Highway. I started in San Francisco and took 9 days to drive down the coast to San Diego, making many stops along the way. Here are just a few highlights from my incredible trip.

        I spent 3 days and 2 nights in San Francisco. I went to the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Lands End, Lucasfilm HQ, Fisherman's Wharf and many other amazing places. SF is awesome!

        I stayed one night in Big Sur at a creepy motel called Fernwood Resort in the middle of nowhere. I drove down the coast and stopped at any beautiful place I saw along the way, including Bixby Bridge, Santa Cruz, and Laguna Beach.

        Joshua Tree was incredible. I climbed massive rocks and was lucky enough to see both ends of a magical double rainbow on my drive in.

        Disneyland rocks! I met Darth Vader and Chewbacca and rode all sorts of badass rides. My friend Susanne and I spent 14 hours at Disney. We didn't leave until after 1am!

        I only got to spend 2 nights in San Diego, which I'm still sad about. It was a beautiful city. I went to Point Loma, watched the sunset off of a cliff, walked around La Jolla and even went skydiving!
